	C - Function pointers
In this session I have to know about:
	1. What are function pointers and how to use them
	2. What does a function pointer exactly hold
	3. where does function pointer point to in the virtual memory.

0. A function that prints a name.
1. A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element
	of an array.
2. A function that searches for an integer.
	cmp is a pointer to the function to be used to compare values
3. A program that performs simple operations.
