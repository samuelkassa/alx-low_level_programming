	#0x14. C - Bit manipulation
From This task I learned:
	. Look for the right source of information without too much help
	. How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

The Tasks are:
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1.1 Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2.10 Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3.11 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 a given index.
4.100 Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5.101 Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip
	to get from one nubmer to another.
